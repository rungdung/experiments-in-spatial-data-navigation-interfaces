# Experiments-in-spatial-data-navigation-interfaces
This is a repository of experimental web interfaces made for navigating spatial data. 

## Development focus
Made with the intent of developing museum-like data interfaces for navigating data about landscape ecology in Kodagu, Karnataka, India.

## Overall thought process
- Both prototypes of mine have depended on a very simple user interface. 
	- "2D-stylised-map" divides spatial data into equal units. In my opinion that might allow for easier digestion of large maps. Would it be a more equitable way of understanding resources if we can summarise for every square kilometre, instead of for every country or for every state?
	- "region-selector" allows for interactive network visualisations to be realised on web maps. Inspired by [Obsidian, a note taking tool](obsidian.md). This allows for complex relationship webs to be seen.
