# Experiments in spatial data navigation interfaces
This is a repository of experimental web interfaces made for navigating spatial data. 

## Development focus
Made with the intent of developing museum-like data interfaces for navigating data about landscape ecology in Kodagu, Karnataka, India.

# Interface 1 titled "2D-stylised-map"
- https://rungdung.github.io/experiments-in-spatial-data-navigation-interfaces/2D-stylised-map/index.html
- Was intended to be a gamified interface.
- Grid based data search interface
  
# Completed Roadmap
- Navigation on a grid where each coordinate is referenced to an index in a DB
- DB is multiple statically loaded JSON files
- Static site UI
- Used Try Catch for the first time ever. WHOOhoo

# Incomplete Roadmap
- Actual data summary instead of dummy data
- Slider for changing databases. Works, bugs present.
- Raster image being overlayed with a grid (canvas pixels). Obviously need to come up with a better solution

# Pitfalls
- P5 might not have been the best idea....Need to refactor some code to not run 60 times a second! :facepalm

## Libraries and guidance used
- p5js.org
- JSON DBs generated by https://www.mockaroo.com/
- References to Stack Overflow answers have been commented as required.
