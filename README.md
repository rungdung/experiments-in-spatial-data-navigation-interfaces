A few months ago, in a contextual class that was looking at complex systems, I prototyped an interface that visualised line of sight on a map, and based interactions off of that. 

I write about that [here](https://rungdung.github.io/posts/visualising-line-of-sight-in-2d/)

Fast-forward, I was asked to visualise a museum experience online for the community of Kodavas, or the people of Kodagu, popularly known as Coorg. While I chose to focus on landscape ecology, it was a timebound project. I had to conceptualise, wireframe and prototype it in 18 hours. 

While my wireframe had been inspired to be a complete museum experience, my prototype focussed on the interactions. 
Note: Both prototypes are static sites, all data is being loaded as static files, including data sets.

1. The first prototype intends to *gamify* the context by introducing a pixellised map where users hop from pixel to pixel. [See it here](https://rungdung.github.io/experiments-in-spatial-data-navigation-interfaces/2D-stylised-map/)
   1. My retrospective reasoning for why this would be an interesting interface is because it would reduce all units of geographic countries, states, towns and villages to a unit system. All squares are of the same size and data is summarised for each square. All data will be per square unit, simplifying data interpretation.
   
2. The second prototype looks into drawing network graphs on interactive web maps. Related data, for example, export relationships between villages can be visualised by interactive networks. [See it here](/https://rungdung.github.io/experiments-in-spatial-data-navigation-interfaces/region-selector/)
